This project is my first attempt at coding UI components to build an interactive and reactive landing page. It was created as part of a bootcamp session at Le Wagon. The primary goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate my skills in front-end development, creating a visually appealing and functional landing page that effectively redirects users to the Le Wagon website. <br>
